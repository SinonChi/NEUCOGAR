SpikeNetwork 

Simple interactive spiking network of 1 self-connected IAF neuron with memory effect. Based on materials from http://www.easyprog.ru/

The neuron has 3 synapses:
1st: weight=1.00, input="user-input current, button 1" (as thalamic input) 
2nd: weight=0.82, input="outut from its own axon"
3rd: weight=-1.0, input="user-input current, button 2"
